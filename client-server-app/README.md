### LILI ###
### A little friendly chat-bot ###
In this project was realised a connection between servers and clients modules by Socket & ServerSocket classes.

This project was made with:
- Java modules;
- Apache Maven.

Moreover, there was made a simple cute menu and chat-bots behaviour.

You may ask it to draw:

Or Lilly may sing you a lullaby if you wanna sleep:

The code is written in such a way that the client's work is completed after the user enters an exit message. At the same time, the server continues its work, waiting for a response from the client.

Please, enjoy it.
